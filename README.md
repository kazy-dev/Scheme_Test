# Scheme_Test

This project is a sample project to add an Xcode scheme.
There are three types of sukim.
DEBUG, RELEASE, STAGING.

I added Build Target, Build Scheme and Build Configuration to make the scheme three.

This is a simple sample application that adds a macro to ViewController.swift from the initial settings of the Xcode single view application and loads the log.

good luck.
